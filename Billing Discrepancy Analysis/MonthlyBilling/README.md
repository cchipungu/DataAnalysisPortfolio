### **Data exploration**
**Key questions for data exploration to address problem 2:**  
1.	For each month what percentage of the total hours worked was overtime and what percentage was normal time?  
2.	Which month had the most overtime?  
3.	How does total hours worked compare with effective billed hours?    
These insights will show if it was overtime that inflated costs for the months in question.  
4.	What was each department's contribution to total overtime as a percentage?
5.	What was each department's contribution to total workload (call outs made) as a percentage?
6.	What was each department's efficiency index - calculated by dividing overtime contribution percentage by workload contribution percentage?  
These insights will reveal which departments use more overtime than expected based on workload and will guide management's intervention.
 
**Efficiency index key:**  
- **Greater than 1** - Department uses more overtime than expected based on workload.
- **Equal to 1** - Department's overtime is proportional to workload.
- **Less than 1**	- Department uses less overtime than expected.
